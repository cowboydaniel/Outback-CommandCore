# Training Dataset: Python Basics

## Source
This corpus is an original, curated set of small Python examples authored for Outback-CommandCore.
It is intended to be self-contained and safe to redistribute.

## License
MIT License (permissive). See the manifest for the license identifier.

## Intended Use
Use these examples for lightweight, local training or evaluation of Python syntax and patterns.
The dataset emphasizes broad coverage across core language features (functions, control flow,
data structures, classes, typing, async, error handling, concurrency, I/O, and standard library
usage) while staying compact and CPU-friendly.

## Size and Limits
* Files: 40
* Total size: ~22 KB (22384 bytes)
* Scope: compact, example-driven coverage of core Python features; no external dependencies beyond the
  standard library.

If you expand the dataset, keep it small enough for local CPU training and update the manifest
accordingly.
