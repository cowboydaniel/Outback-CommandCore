# DROIDCOM (Droid Command)

DROIDCOM is a comprehensive Android diagnostic, penetration, and system control tool within CommandCore, designed for both forensic and offensive security operations.

## Key Features

- **Wide Compatibility**: Extensive support for various Android OS versions and device models
- **Root Management**: Root detection, lock-screen bypass/brute-force, and boot integrity verification
- **Security Scanning**: Encryption, lock screen, dangerous permissions, certificate, AppOps, and keystore audits
- **Remote Control**: Secure shell and command execution interface for device management
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time battery, memory, CPU, network, thermal, storage, and service monitoring
- **Stress & Benchmark Testing**: CPU/RAM/GPU/Dalvik cache stress tests, app crash forcing, and looped benchmarking
- **Automation**: Shell script execution, batch app management, scheduled tasks, and combined logcat/screencap capture
- **Forensics Integration**: Native Andriller extraction/lockscreen cracking plus launchers for ALEAPP, MVT, and Autopsy
- **Acquisition Imaging**: Logical (tar-stream) device image with a SHA-256 computed and recorded at capture time, with later re-verification against that recorded hash
- **Write Blocker Enforcement**: Toggleable guard that rejects device-mutating ADB commands (install/uninstall/clear-data/push, etc.) while active, with every check logged
- **Chain of Custody Reporting**: PDF (or text fallback) report with examiner name, case/exhibit numbers, timestamps, device info, and acquisition hashes
- **Case Management**: Organises acquisitions and reports on disk by case number and exhibit number
- **Evidence Integrity Log**: Hash-chained, append-only audit trail of every case action, with built-in tamper detection

## Requirements

### Python Version
- Python 3.10 or higher

### Python Dependencies
Install via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- `PySide6>=6.5.0` – Qt6 GUI framework
- `reportlab` (optional) – PDF chain-of-custody reports; falls back to a plain-text report if not installed

### UI Baseline
DROIDCOM now targets PySide6 exclusively. Legacy Tkinter compatibility has been
removed in favor of native Qt widgets and dialogs (`QMessageBox`,
`QFileDialog`, `QDialog`).

### Supported Platforms
- Linux (primary – full ADB support)
- Windows (with ADB drivers installed)
- macOS (with ADB installed)

### OS-Level Dependencies
DROIDCOM requires Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and related tools, plus `scrcpy`
(>= 2.1) for screen mirroring/control. DROIDCOM will attempt to auto-install
both on Linux at startup, but installing them yourself first avoids the
pkexec prompts.

> **See [docs/system-deps.md](../docs/system-deps.md#droidcom) for comprehensive system dependency documentation.**

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot scrcpy
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install android-tools scrcpy
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install android-platform-tools scrcpy
```

**Windows:**
- Download [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- Download [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases)
- Add both to system PATH

Required tools:
- `adb` – Android Debug Bridge
- `fastboot` – Bootloader/recovery communication
- `scrcpy` (>= 2.1) – Screen mirroring and input control

Distro-packaged `scrcpy` is frequently older than 2.1; DROIDCOM detects this
and builds the latest release from source automatically on Linux at startup.

### Permissions
- USB device access (user in `plugdev` group on Linux)
- USB debugging must be enabled on target Android device
- Device authorization required on first connection

### Android Device Setup
1. Enable Developer Options on the Android device
2. Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options
3. Connect device via USB
4. Accept the RSA key fingerprint prompt on the device

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the DROIDCOM directory
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install OS-level dependencies (see above)
4. Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled
5. Launch the application

## Usage

### Entry Point
```bash
# Run as module from repository root
python -m DROIDCOM

# Or run directly
python DROIDCOM/main.py
```

### Module Path
`DROIDCOM` (package with `main.py` entry point)

- **Forensics** – Native Andriller extraction and lockscreen cracker dialog, plus launchers for ALEAPP, MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit), and Autopsy (see [docs/system-deps.md](../docs/system-deps.md#droidcom) for optional install instructions)

- **Evidence & Custody** – Open a case (case number, exhibit number, examiner name) to create an on-disk case/exhibit folder structure; acquire a logical, hash-verified image of the device (tar-stream of a chosen device path, SHA-256 computed at capture and re-checkable later); enable/disable the write blocker, which inspects every ADB command issued through the guarded paths and refuses anything classified as a write (`install`, `uninstall`, `push`, `pm clear`, etc.) while active; view the evidence log, an append-only, hash-chained record of every case action (case opened, commands allowed/blocked, acquisitions, verifications, report generation) with one-click chain-integrity verification; and generate a chain-of-custody report (PDF via `reportlab` if installed, otherwise a plain-text report) summarizing the case, device info, acquisition hashes, and full evidence log

  > **Scope note:** acquisition is a *logical* image (a tar stream of the requested path over ADB), not a physical bit-for-bit dump of the underlying flash/block device — most Android devices do not expose that without root. The write blocker covers ADB commands issued through DROIDCOM's guarded code paths (install/uninstall/clear-data APK management plus the acquisition pipeline itself); it is not a kernel- or USB-level hardware write blocker for every code path in the application.
